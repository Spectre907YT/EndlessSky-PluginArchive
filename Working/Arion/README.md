# Arion - Air Superiority

An Endless Sky plugin that adds a variety of things to endless sky, including: 

- Real life fighters
  
- Real life bombers
  
- Ace combat super planes
  
- Xenonauts fighters
  
- A bunch of new H2H weapons based on real life weapons
  
- Advanced outfits
  
- Specialized weapons
  
- Superweapons
  
- Custom capital ships
  
- 1 (or 2) new 'short campaigns' and some new jobs
  
- ETC

To get access to some of the content visit Earth, Valhalla, Hephaestus or Bourne. Perhaps helping them out by doing some jobs and mission is a good idea. You can also just have a high combat rating or finish the main campaign (although you should probably just visit the mentioned planets).

There are also some bonus content if you have the lost in midnight, mega freight, czartraks ships, amphibious ships, altera or navycampaign (by kestrel1110) plugin. To access the bonus content, move the respective files from the bonus file to the data file.

(Special thanks to 1010todd, yuyuko_saigyouji. and gefulltetaubenbrust from the Endless Sky discord server for letting me borrow some sprites)
